Median time is reported in milliseconds for `ok` records.
Inputs are prepared on the GPU before timed runs; initial host-to-device transfer is outside the timed region.
Timed runs include the host API call and backend-native device synchronization. tenferro-rs CUDA uses the explicit tenferro-rs synchronize API without downloading result tensors in the timed region.
Dense and einsum inputs use the same deterministic benchmark generator in the Rust and Python runners; host-to-device layout conversion remains outside the timed region.
tenferro-rs uses native column-major GPU tensors; PyTorch and vendor-wrapper columns use their native row-major framework tensors unless noted.
The cuSOLVER column is torch.linalg with preferred_linalg_library=cusolver; for SVD it pins driver=gesvd as a QR-based cuSOLVER comparison. tenferro-rs CUDA SVD uses its backend default driver policy, currently gesvdj for matrices with both dimensions at most 1024 and gesvd otherwise.
Non-`ok` cells show the structured backend status.

## gpu/sparse / spmm / allocating output

| Problem | PyTorch CUDA |
|---|---:|
| sparse_synthetic_64k_4m_spmm_f64_rhs1024 | 14.910 |

## gpu/sparse / spmv / allocating output

| Problem | PyTorch CUDA |
|---|---:|
| sparse_synthetic_4m_64m_spmv_f64 | 2.293 |

## Sampling

JAX uses compiled JIT execution; compilation, planning and numerical checks are outside timing. PyTorch uses eager execution. Samples retain every output until native synchronization and clock stop. Values are normalized per declared operation.

| Problem | Backend | Ops/sample | Raw batch ms | Setup and precision |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| sparse_synthetic_4m_64m_spmv_f64 | pytorch-cuda | 1 | 2.29584, 2.29292, 2.29304, 2.29603, 2.29225, 2.29711, 2.28935 | inputs/transfers, plans, compilation, lazy initialization and validation outside clocks; JAX x64/highest; PyTorch TF32 disabled |
| sparse_synthetic_64k_4m_spmm_f64_rhs1024 | pytorch-cuda | 1 | 14.912, 14.9043, 14.9077, 14.91, 14.9079, 14.9111, 14.9103 | inputs/transfers, plans, compilation, lazy initialization and validation outside clocks; JAX x64/highest; PyTorch TF32 disabled |

## Output retention bounds

These intrinsic single outputs exceed the configured batch budget. Samples contain one operation; the effective bound is raised explicitly to that one output, without shrinking the workload.

| Problem | Backend | Bytes/output | Configured budget | Effective bound | Ops/sample |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sparse_synthetic_64k_4m_spmm_f64_rhs1024 | pytorch-cuda | 536870912 | 268435456 | 536870912 | 1 |
