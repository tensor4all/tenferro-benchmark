Median time is reported in milliseconds for `ok` records.
Inputs are prepared on the GPU before timed runs; initial host-to-device transfer is outside the timed region.
Timed runs include the host API call and backend-native device synchronization. tenferro-rs CUDA uses the explicit tenferro-rs synchronize API without downloading result tensors in the timed region.
Dense and einsum inputs use the same deterministic benchmark generator in the Rust and Python runners; host-to-device layout conversion remains outside the timed region.
tenferro-rs uses native column-major GPU tensors; PyTorch and vendor-wrapper columns use their native row-major framework tensors unless noted.
The cuSOLVER column is torch.linalg with preferred_linalg_library=cusolver; for SVD it pins driver=gesvd as a QR-based cuSOLVER comparison. tenferro-rs CUDA SVD uses its backend default driver policy, currently gesvdj for matrices with both dimensions at most 1024 and gesvd otherwise.
Non-`ok` cells show the structured backend status.

## gpu/tensornetwork / tensor_network_contract / allocating output

| Problem | tenferro-rs CUDA trace | tenferro-rs CUDA eager | PyTorch CUDA |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| tensornetwork_permutation_optimized_f32 | 42.499 | 44.973 | 102.313 |

## Sampling

JAX uses compiled JIT execution; compilation, planning and numerical checks are outside timing. PyTorch uses eager execution. Samples retain every output until native synchronization and clock stop. Values are normalized per declared operation.

| Problem | Backend | Ops/sample | Raw batch ms | Setup and precision |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| tensornetwork_permutation_optimized_f32 | tenferro-cuda-trace | 1 | 42.4471, 43.2931, 42.3973, 42.4494, 44.9978, 44.9903, 42.7416, 42.4828, 42.5153, 42.4797 | one caller-held CUDA engine for every sample; each Runtime::run call pays its own device-completion barrier inside the batch interval; inputs, plans and compilation outside clocks; native declared dtype; no AD recording |
| tensornetwork_permutation_optimized_f32 | tenferro-cuda-eager | 1 | 44.9412, 45.9324, 44.9347, 44.9788, 45.1024, 44.9622, 46.706, 44.952, 44.968, 45.9871 | one entered eager session; input wrapping, transfers, argument handles, initialization and validation outside clocks; native declared dtype; no AD recording |
| tensornetwork_permutation_optimized_f32 | pytorch-cuda | 1 | 102.068, 102.262, 102.06, 102.68, 102.122, 102.923, 102.169, 102.818, 102.363, 104.01 | inputs/transfers, plans, compilation, lazy initialization and validation outside clocks; JAX x64/highest; PyTorch TF32 disabled |
