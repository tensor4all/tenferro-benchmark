Median time is reported in milliseconds for `ok` records.
Inputs are prepared on the GPU before timed runs; initial host-to-device transfer is outside the timed region.
Timed runs include the host API call and backend-native device synchronization. tenferro-rs CUDA uses the explicit tenferro-rs synchronize API without downloading result tensors in the timed region.
Dense and einsum inputs use the same deterministic benchmark generator in the Rust and Python runners; host-to-device layout conversion remains outside the timed region.
tenferro-rs uses native column-major GPU tensors; PyTorch and vendor-wrapper columns use their native row-major framework tensors unless noted.
The cuSOLVER column is torch.linalg with preferred_linalg_library=cusolver; for SVD it pins driver=gesvd as a QR-based cuSOLVER comparison. tenferro-rs CUDA SVD uses its backend default driver policy, currently gesvdj for matrices with both dimensions at most 1024 and gesvd otherwise.
Non-`ok` cells show the structured backend status.

## gpu/tensornetwork / tensor_network_contract / allocating output

| Problem | tenferro-rs CUDA trace | tenferro-rs CUDA eager | PyTorch CUDA | JAX CUDA tree JIT |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| tensornetwork_permutation_optimized_f32 | 82.803 | 101.861 | 111.330 | 132.346 |

## Sampling

JAX uses compiled JIT execution; compilation, planning and numerical checks are outside timing. PyTorch uses eager execution. Samples retain every output until native synchronization and clock stop. Values are normalized per declared operation.

| tensornetwork_permutation_optimized_f32 | tenferro-cuda-trace | 1 | 145.75, 94.9893, 82.2506, 82.4253, 82.4645, 136.823, 92.7811, 81.6886, 80.6974, 83.1418 | one caller-held CUDA engine for every sample; each Runtime::run call pays its own device-completion barrier inside the batch interval; inputs, plans and compilation outside clocks; native declared dtype; no AD recording |
