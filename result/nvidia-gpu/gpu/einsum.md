Median time is reported in milliseconds for `ok` records.
Inputs are prepared on the GPU before timed runs; initial host-to-device transfer is outside the timed region.
Timed runs include the host API call and backend-native device synchronization. tenferro-rs CUDA uses the explicit tenferro-rs synchronize API without downloading result tensors in the timed region.
Dense and einsum inputs use the same deterministic benchmark generator in the Rust and Python runners; host-to-device layout conversion remains outside the timed region.
tenferro-rs uses native column-major GPU tensors; PyTorch and vendor-wrapper columns use their native row-major framework tensors unless noted.
The cuSOLVER column is torch.linalg with preferred_linalg_library=cusolver; for SVD it pins driver=gesvd as a QR-based cuSOLVER comparison. tenferro-rs CUDA SVD uses its backend default driver policy, currently gesvdj for matrices with both dimensions at most 1024 and gesvd otherwise.
Non-`ok` cells show the structured backend status.

## gpu/einsum / einsum / allocating output

| Problem | tenferro-rs CUDA trace | tenferro-rs CUDA eager | PyTorch CUDA |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| einsum_bin_matmul_3072_f64 | 3.252 | 3.167 | 3.182 |

## Sampling

JAX uses compiled JIT execution; compilation, planning and numerical checks are outside timing. PyTorch uses eager execution. Samples retain every output until native synchronization and clock stop. Values are normalized per declared operation.

| Problem | Backend | Ops/sample | Raw batch ms | Setup and precision |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| einsum_bin_matmul_3072_f64 | tenferro-cuda-trace | 1 | 3.22141, 3.23043, 3.24006, 3.28343, 3.25865, 3.26684, 3.25194 | one caller-held CUDA engine for every sample; each Runtime::run call pays its own device-completion barrier inside the batch interval; inputs, plans and compilation outside clocks; native declared dtype; no AD recording |
| einsum_bin_matmul_3072_f64 | tenferro-cuda-eager | 1 | 3.18229, 3.37117, 3.16718, 3.16422, 3.16196, 3.16197, 3.1743 | one entered eager session; input wrapping, transfers, argument handles, initialization and validation outside clocks; native declared dtype; no AD recording |
| einsum_bin_matmul_3072_f64 | pytorch-cuda | 1 | 3.18784, 3.18215, 3.17992, 3.18215, 3.18115, 3.1801, 3.19227 | inputs/transfers, plans, compilation, lazy initialization and validation outside clocks; JAX x64/highest; PyTorch TF32 disabled |
